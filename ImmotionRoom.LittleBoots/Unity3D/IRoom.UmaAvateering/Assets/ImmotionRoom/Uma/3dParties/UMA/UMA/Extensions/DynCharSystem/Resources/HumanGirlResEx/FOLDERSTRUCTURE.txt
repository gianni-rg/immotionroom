My thinking here is that this folder should contain everything needed to make a naked model of the race.

The idea is to simplify the myriad of folders that UMA creates into two[ish] RaceBase and Wardrobe[i] 

So 
-RaceBase will contain everything needed to make a naked version of the race
-Wardrobe[i] will contain wardrobe recipes and all the slots/overlays necessary to create them. You might have more than one wardrobe folder and add them over time via asset bundles
-You may also have Animations[i] folders that will contains animations for the race which you can again add to over time via assetBundles


SUGGESTED NAMING FORMAT FOR UMA ASSET BUNDLES

I strongly believe that Races are the foundation of UMA so I suggest that when naming asset bundles they should be named thusly:-

First of all we can make AssetBundleManager load things that start with x/

so if we name our assetbundles starting with 

uma

we can make AssetBundleManager download everything in uma/

next I think we should define things by race so

uma/humanmale
uma/humanfemale

This will donload everything in those races, all base meshes/overlays/racedatas/animations etc

next we should define a folder for the racebase, this is everything that is required to create a naked version of our race, including the race data, tpose, expressions, and a base recipe with its required overlays and slots and textures, so

uma/humanmale/racebase
uma/humanfemale/racebase

next we should package our wardrobe recipes up into bundles that we can add to so

uma/humanmale/wardrobe1
uma/humanmale/wardrobe2
etc

Lastly we should package up animations the same way so

uma/humanmale/animations1
uma/humanmale/animations2
etc

BUT maybe we should do this so that all wardrobes or animations can be downloaded too? Thoughts on a postcard? i.e.

uma/humanmale/animations/animations1
uma/humanmale/animations/animations2

This way we could load uma/humanmale/animations and load both or all animation bundles if we wanted?
